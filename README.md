# Competitive-Programming-Stuff

This is a repository of resources for competitive programming. I have started competitive programming since I was in the 9th grade and have benefitted tremendously from a variety of online resources since then in learning interest, but often complicated, algorithms and data structures. This repository contains the must-do problems in my heart!

### How to use it?
You can easily find the description of each problem online - POJ, Contest Hunter, and Luogu are the three popular online judge platforms I used. The source code of each problem explicitly shows where this problem comes from and where you can go to find it. I recommend you have a thorough thinking into each problem before diving into my code. Some of my codes include the algorithms I used to solve that problem.
